# Color-detection
Some Real-world Applications
In self-driving car, to detect the traffic signals.
Multiple color detection is used in some industrial robots, to performing pick-and-place task in separating different colored objects.

Python Libraries Used:
NumPy
OpenCV-Python

Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. This project can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
